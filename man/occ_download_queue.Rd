occ_download_queue(..., .list = list())

\arguments{
\item{...}{any number of \code{\link[=occ_download]{occ_download()}} requests}

\item{.list}{any number of \code{\link[=occ_download]{occ_download()}} requests as \code{lazy}
objects, called with e.g., \code{lazyeval::lazy()}}
}

a list of \code{occ_download} class objects, see \code{\link[=occ_download_get]{occ_download_get()}}

\description{
Download requests in a queue
}
\details{
This function is a convenience wrapper around \code{\link[=occ_download]{occ_download()}},
allowing the user to kick off any number of requests, while abiding by
GBIF rules of 3 concurrent requests per user.
}
\note{
see \link{downloads} for an overview of GBIF downloads methods
}
\section{How it works}{

It works by using lazy evaluation to collect your requests into a queue.
Then it kicks of the first 3 requests. Then in a while loop, we check
status of those requests, and when any request finishes, we kick off the
next, and so on. So in theory, there may not always strictly be 3 running
concurrently, but the function will usually provide for 3 running
concurrently.

out <- occ_download_queue(
  occ_download('taxonKey = 3119195', "year = 1976"),
  occ_download('taxonKey = 3119195', "year = 2001"),
  occ_download('taxonKey = 3119195', "year = 2001", "month <= 8"),
  occ_download('taxonKey = 5229208', "year = 2011"),
  occ_download('taxonKey = 2480946', "year = 2015"),
  occ_download("country = NZ", "year = 1999", "month = 3"),
  occ_download("catalogNumber = Bird.27847588", "year = 1998", "month = 2")
)

# supports <= 3 requests too
out <- occ_download_queue(
  occ_download("country = NZ", "year = 1999", "month = 3"),
  occ_download("catalogNumber = Bird.27847588", "year = 1998", "month = 2")
)
}
