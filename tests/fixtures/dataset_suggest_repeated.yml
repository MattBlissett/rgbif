        Backbone Taxonomy\",\"description\":\"The GBIF Backbone Taxonomy, often called
        the Nub taxonomy, is a single synthetic management classification with the
        goal of covering all names GBIF is dealing with.             It's the taxonomic
        backbone that allows GBIF to integrate name based information from different
        resources, no matter if these are occurrence datasets, species pages, names
        from nomenclators or external sources like EOL, Genbank or IUCN.             This
        backbone allows taxonomic search, browse and reporting operations across all
        those resources in a consistent way and to provide means to crosswalk names
        from one source to another.             It is updated regulary through an
        automated process in which the Catalogue of Life acts as a starting point
        also providing the complete higher classification above families.             The

        Taxonomic Information System (ITIS)\",\"description\":\"The White House Subcommittee
        on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics has identified systematics as a research
        priority that is fundamental to ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation.
        This primary need identified by the Subcommittee requires improvements in
        the organization of, and access to, standardized nomenclature. ITIS (originally
        referred to as the Interagency Taxonomic Information System) was designed
        to fulfill these requirements. In the future, the ITIS will provide taxonomic
        data and a directory of taxonomic expertise that will support the system.\\n\\nThe
        ITIS is the result of a partnership of federal agencies formed to satisfy
        their mutual needs for scientifically credible taxonomic information. Since
        its inception, ITIS has gained valuable new partners and undergone a name
        change; ITIS now stands for the Integrated Taxonomic Information System.\\n\\nThe
        goal is to create an easily accessible database with reliable information
        on species names and their hierarchical classification. The database will
        be reviewed periodically to ensure high quality with valid classifications,
        revisions, and additions of newly described species. The ITIS includes documented
        taxonomic information of flora and fauna from both aquatic and terrestrial
        habitats.\\n\\nThe original ITIS partners include:\\nDepartment of Commerce\\n
        \   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\\nDepartment of
        Interior (DOI)\\n    Geological Survey (USGS)\\nEnvironmental Protection Agency
        (EPA)\\nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA)\\n    Agriculture Research Service
        (ARS)\\n    Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)\\nSmithsonian Institution\\n
        \   National Museum of Natural History (NMNH)\\n\\nThese agencies signed a
        Memorandum of Understanding and have formed a Steering Committee that directs
        two technical work groups - the Database Work Group (DWG) and the Taxonomy
        Work Group (TWG). The DWG is responsible for the database design and overseeing
        development of the system to meet the requirements of the ITIS partners. The
        TWG is responsible for the quality and integrity of the database information.
        In addition to the database, the working groups have created &#34;Taxonomic
        Workbench&#34; software designed for easy entry and manipulation of taxonomic
        data.\\n\\nPrimary objectives of the TWG include the review of data prior
        to incorporation into the ITIS and the establishment of a process for periodic
        peer review to ensure data quality. The TWG has evaluated the taxonomic information
        priorities of the agencies and is locating data sources for the highest priority
        groups. Efforts to gather data are helping to identify gaps in taxonomic coverage
        in both scientific expertise and available information. The TWG hopes to promote
        collaboration among, and provide a point of focus for, taxonomists, scientific
        institutions, and taxonomic information users.\\n\\nFor each scientific name,
        ITIS will include the authority (author and date), taxonomic rank, associated
        synonyms and vernacular names where available, a unique taxonomic serial number,
        data source information (publications, experts, etc.) and data quality indicators.
        Expert reviews and changes to taxonomic information in the database will be
        tracked. Geographic coverage will be worldwide with initial emphasis on North
        American taxa. The TWG is coordinating its efforts with several national and
        international biodiversity programs.\\n\\nITIS will be a significant contribution
        to the scientific infrastructure that is fundamental to the description, conservation,
        and management of the nation&#39;s biodiversity. Use of the ITIS and the taxonomic
        serial numbers will facilitate sharing of biological information among researchers
        and cooperating agencies by providing a common framework for taxonomic data.
        Agencies that typically cannot afford to maintain taxonomic data will have
        access to high quality taxonomic information through ITIS. This project allows
        the coordination of efforts among federal agencies, thereby increasing productivity
        and saving resources.\\n\\nStatus reports on ITIS system development may be

        and year of publication and the linking of most homotypic names. New names
        from the Index of Fungi, compiled at CABI-UK and published by CABI, are added
        every three months.\\n\\nThe Bibliography of Systematic Mycology provides
        a survey of the literature encompassing the biodiversity, classification,
        distribution, evolution, identification, nomenclature, phylogeny, systematics
        and taxonomy of fungi (as defined in the previous paragraph). You can search
        the database using the index of cited generic names or author names.\\n\\nThe
        Dictionary of the Fungi (currently 10th edition, 2008) published by CABI also
        contains the current consensus on the fungal taxonomic hierarchy to the rank
        of genus. Here you can search the database for the status of generic names,
        or walk down the hierarchy from the rank of Kingdom. The entries for each
        genus generally include authors and place of publication together with the
        type species (linked to Index Fungorum) and other data. A database of family
        names which includes authors, place of publication and type genus (linked
        to the Dictionary of the Fungi hierarchy) is now supplemented by one which
        contains names at all supra-familial ranks although it is far from completion.\\n\\nCABI
        Bioscience is presently coordinating the fungal component of the Species 2000
        project and its contribution, in partnership with ITIS, to the Catalogue of
        Life (currently used in the GBIF portal); for more information regarding this
        global initiative visit their website. You may search here a small but growing
        number of taxonomically complete datasets - global species databases. Please

        in Flux Checklist\",\"description\":\"Aves - A Taxonomy in Flux\\nVersion
        2.87: June 02 2013\\n\\nThere are big changes underway in bird taxonomy. You've
        probably noticed that the checklist is always changing. Suddenly the ducks
        have replaced the loons in front of the NGS guide. Not too long ago the shrikes
        and vireos were next to the warblers, now they're next to the jays. Maybe
        you've heard that vultures are storks, or that they're not really storks after
        all, or that North American tanagers are now cardinals, or that saltators
        are tanagers, not cardinals. Then there are the Baltimore and Bullock's Orioles,
        or are they just Northern Orioles? Are they Slate-colored and Oregon Juncos,
        or maybe it's Dark-eyed Junco today. Not only are species being split or lumped,
        but everything is being rearranged. A new view of bird taxonomy takes shape
        as we watch.\\n\\nThere have always been questions and disagreements about
        bird taxonomy, and it has always been changing (see Bruce, 2003). Since Aristotle
        or before, people have tried to find a natural way to order all bird species
        (the very words “genus” and “species” carry the Aristotelean tradition). Early
        attempts were based on obvious similarities, such as grouping all waterbirds
        together. But what constitutes a natural order?\\n\\nLinnaeus simplified scientific
        nomenclature by naming each type bird with a genus and species, but was unable
        to tell us what order was natural. It is not until Darwin that we get a clearcut
        way to order the birds. They should be ordered according to descent. Birds
        with more recent common ancestors should be grouped together.\\n\\nThomas
        Huxley (1867) was the first to construct a comprehensive bird list on Darwinian
        lines. He focused on the characteristics of the bird's skull to determine
        common inherited features that he could base his taxonomy on. Numerous other
        ornithologists have used morphological traits to classify the birds, with
        Livezey and Zusi (2007) being the most recent effort of this type.\\n\\nMore
        recently, focus has shifted to molecular methods, the most important of which
        is to directly study the stuff of inheritance—DNA. The culmination of the
        first wave of DNA based taxonomy were the publications by Sibley, Ahlquist,
        and Monroe (Sibley, Ahlquist, and Monroe, 1988; Sibley and Ahlquist, 1990;
        Sibley and Monroe, 1990). Sibley, Ahlquist, and Monroe used DNA hybridization
        to try to classify birds. This, together with increasing emphasis on cladistic
        methods, has revitalized interest in bird taxonomy. In the 1990's, DNA hybridization
        was replaced by the much more precise DNA sequencing, allowing direct examination
        of the genes themselves. This has opened the possibility of constructing a
        “tree of life” showing the evolutionary relationships between all living organisms.
        It has brought the prospect of producing a completely accurate taxonomic tree
        of all living bird species, and touched off an onslaught of new research.
        This ongoing research is the driving force behind the checklist changes.\\n\\nThis
        set of web pages contains a guess at what the avian part of the tree of life
        might look like. It examines recent taxonomic changes, and possible changes
        to come. Some of the projected changes are pretty solid, others are guesses
        based on current research. Keep in mind that some of my guesses will turn
        out to be wrong, and some of the research they are based will be wrong or
        misleading. There will doubtless be taxonomic surprises before the entire
        avian tree is worked out, just as there have been a number of recent surprises.\\n\\nThe
        “Tapestry” on Steroids\\nUnlike all of the other current checklists, the TiF
        checklist includes explicit phylogenetic hypotheses whenever possible. These
        hypotheses are embodied in tree diagrams. From the beginning, the TiF list
        has used an explicit family-level tree. That has now been extended to a genus-level
        tree for most families (now over 95%). In some cases it has been pushed to
        the species level, and in a very few cases, even to subspecies.\\n\\nPreviously,
        only the combination of Sibley and Monroe (1990) and Sibley and Ahlquist (1990)
        had attempted anything of this sort, their famous “tapestry”. However, they
        had nowhere near the coverage that is now possible. One of the goals of this
        checklist is to provide a tapestry on steroids that will eventually include
        all extant bird species.\\n\\nThe tree I've put together is an interpretation
        of the genetic relationships studied by many authors. The higher level taxonomy
        (the non-passerines) I use is primarily based on Hackett et al. (2008), which
        refines the results of Ericson et al. (2006a) and Fain and Houde (2004). This
        taxonomy is slowly creeping into the checklists. The latest (2008) of Christidis
        and Boles Australian checklist incorporates some of these ideas, as does the
        AOU's South American checklist.\\n\\nThe purpose of these webpages is twofold:
        To present the new ideas that Fain and Houde's Metaves hypothesis has brought
        to the higher taxonomy (mostly above the family level), and to examine the
        wholesale changes that been going on within the various families. The latter
        has particularly affected the passerine families, which at times seems like
        they've been run through a blender (see the Sylviidae page for an example).\\n\\nThe
        higher-level phylogeny has followed Hackett et al. (2008) since version 2.1.
        I've created a pdf that summarizes the changes from the previous version.
        Since then, I've concentrated on adding as many genus-level phylogenetic family
        trees as are possible (not needed for the one and two genus families). At
        present, under 5% of the extant bird families lack even a draft tree, although
        some of other family trees still have areas of conjecture.\\n\\nI also have
        further information on the Metaves hypothesis and higher-level taxonomy. It
        discusses the composition of the major groups and the relations between them,
        particularly Metaves and Coronaves.\",\"type\":\"CHECKLIST\"},{\"key\":\"80b4b440-eaca-4860-aadf-d0dfdd3e856e\",\"title\":\"Official

        for each taxon: the scientific name, higher classification and stable taxon
        identifier (in the taxon core), the (confidence regarding the) presence of
        the species in each of the four countries, whether the species is native or
        introduced (establishment) (in the distribution extension) and coarse habitat
