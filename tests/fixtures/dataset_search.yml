        - Données flore des CBN agrégées par la FCBN","description":"Dès la création
        de leur Fédération (FCBN - www.fcbn.fr) en 1999, les onze Conservatoires botaniques
        nationaux (CBN) ont exprimé la volonté collective de constituer un système
        d’information national pour mettre en commun leurs données, et celles de leurs
        partenaires, sur la flore, la fonge et les végétations-habitats. C’est réellement
        en 2010 avec le lancement de l’établissement du Format Standard de Données
        sur la flore (FSD Flore), conçu comme le « format commun de données de la
        Fédération des CBN », que la démarche a été initiée. Il s’en est suivi de
        nombreux échanges ayant permis de finaliser le format, de le tester sur les
        premiers jeux de données, d’établir une charte d’adhésion au projet et d’élaborer
        le cadrage final de l’exercice d’agrégation des données. Le projet s’est concrétisé
        au premier trimestre 2013 à travers la mise au format des données détenues
        par les CBN et leur intégration dans le Système d’Information de la FCBN (SI-Flore).
        A l’horizon de l’année 2014, il résulte, de ce projet structurant, que la
        FCBN dispose d’un système d’information d’envergure nationale et fort de plus
        de 20 millions de données d’observation sur la flore de France. Les données
        centralisées ont été consolidées sur la base du référentiel TAXREF 5.0 et
        une mise à jour est prévue pour fin 2015.","type":"OCCURRENCE","hostingOrganizationKey":"5d5e5d82-076c-4e9a-b5b0-c88d1b691a6a","hostingOrganizationTitle":"GBIF

        Bird Surveys","description":"The Garden Bird Survey (GBS) has been run by
        the Canberra Ornithologists Group (COG) since 3 July 1981.  Summary results
        of the GBS are published by COG in the Annual Bird Report  published as an
        issue of \"Canberra Bird Notes\" in hard copy and on the COG website  http://cbn.canberrabirds.org.au/
        (navigate through the link to Canberra Bird Notes).\n\nThe basis of the Survey
        is a site equivalent in area to a circle of 100m in radius around the observer''s
        home or workplace.    Not all sites are circular but all are approximately
        3Ha in area.  There is no restriction on the elevation of the bird when observed,
        and birds flying over the site are included.\n\nMost of the Survey sites are
        located in the urban area of the ACT but some are also located in the City
        of Queanbeyan and the villages and rural residential areas in the areas of
        NSW surrounding the ACT.  A State indicator shows which sites are inside or
        outside the ACT.\n\n\n\nThe observation period is determined by standard starting
        dates for each year, with a year always commencing on 3 July.  In most cases
        the observation period is 7 days so that within each year the starting date
        of each period is the same day of the week.  Exceptions are:\n-\tIn Leap Years
        the period commencing February 26 is 8 days to accommodate the 29 February;
        and\n-\tEvery year the period beginning 25 June is 8 days to enable a seamless
        match to the first day of the week beginning 3 July.\nThe basic counting rule
        is to report the maximum number of birds of a species seen at any time during
        the week.  For example:\n-\tIf ten birds of species \"A\" are seen on the
        first day of a period and twelve on the second day, record \"12\".    \n-\tIf
        in the same period 4 birds of species \"B\" are seen on the second day and
        five birds of species \"B\" are seen on the sixth day report \"5\".  \n\nApplication
        of this rule means that the survey results are not appropriate for measuring
        the numbers of birds that are migrating in flocks since only the biggest flock
        is recorded with no measure of the number of flocks.\n\nIt should be noted
        that number of sites operating in any period may vary, both between years
        and within a year.   The number of sites tends to be low for the periods beginning
        3 and 10 July (due to delays in obtaining new Charts) and from 18 December
        to 8 January due to observers being away on vacation.","type":"OCCURRENCE","hostingOrganizationKey":"3c5e4331-7f2f-4a8d-aa56-81ece7014fc8","hostingOrganizationTitle":"Atlas

        Natural Values Atlas","description":"ABOUT THE NATURAL VALUES ATLAS\nThe Natural
        Values Atlas provides an easy to use web interface allowing access to authoritative
        and comprehensive natural values information.  It draws together in one centralised
        location data on Tasmanian flora and fauna including Threatened species and
        weeds as well as the Tasmanian Geodiversity Database.  It also incorporates
        access to other essential data sets such as TASVEG, Threatened communities
        and Reserves.  The Natural Values Atlas is a supported information tool that
        ensures knowledge about Tasmania''s valuable natural assets is readily available
        and quickly obtained.  This information informs planning and decision making
        processes across all levels of government, industry and the general public,
        assisting to improve conservation outcomes for natural values in the State.\n\nSPECIES\nThe
        Natural Values Atlas is comprised of a database and web based application
        that allows observations of plants and animals from various sources to be
        viewed, recorded and analysed.  It can be used to search for information on
        more than 20,000 plant and animal species from Tasmania, Australia and can
        display maps showing their location and extent.  There are currently over
        1 million observations of plants and animals recorded in the Natural Values
        Atlas which have been collected by a variety of custodians.  This information
        has been generated through general species surveys and projects undertaken
        for scientific research, environmental assessments and other purposes throughout
        the State since the 1800''s.\nThe application maintains species taxonomy,
        attributes and conservation values and provides access to images, related
        web sites and management documents such as listing statements and recovery
        plans.  Habitat Mapping for a number of high priority threatened fauna species
        is also available.  Information sourced from monitoring individual flora and
        fauna species is accessible as well as samples and analysis which allows information
        about samples that are associated with an observation to be recorded and tracked.\n\nGEODIVERSITY\nThe
        Natural Values Atlas can be used to find and download information about sites
        that are listed in the Tasmanian Geodiversty Database either for their geology,
        geomorphology or soil conservation values.  The database contains descriptions
        of the sites and the geodiverstiy values they encompass, their significance
        to conservation, sensitivity to disturbance, and advice as to appropriate
        site management.  The Natural Values Atlas can display maps showing the location
        and extent of sites.\n\nMANAGEMENT\nManagement locations and activities are
        another important area of the Natural Values Atlas which provide access to
        data about locations where activities are being undertaken to control, monitor,
        manage or maintain natural values.  Examples include 1080 baits, traps, nests,
        nest boxes and monitoring plots.\n\nPROJECTS\nAll data stored in the Natural
        Values Atlas is organised under a Project.  This component of the Natural
        Values Atlas contains information regarding the custodian responsible for
        the project, specific project details such as the people involved in the project
        or the methodology used to collect the data.  Associated reports, links and
        images can also be found in this area.  It provides metadata for each project
        data set.\n\nCONSEVATION INFORMATION SYSTEM\nThe Conservation Information
        System (CIS) contains data that assists with conservation planning at the
        landscape scale.  The CIS Conservation Analysis interface allows you to apply
        your own weightings for a particular conservation value to create a map of
        areas that have a high density of the natural values of interest.\n\nNATURAL
        VALUES REPORTS\nNatural Values Reports enables multiple data sets to be brought
        together in the one report providing a resource that can be used for desktop
        assessments of natural values for specific areas.  Some of the data sets available
        through the Natural Values Report facility include: threatened species, species
        of conservation significance, weeds, geodiversity, TASVEG, threatened communities
        and reserves.\n\nQUALITY ASSURANCE\nNew data is loaded into the Natural Values
        Atlas daily and existing data is regularly reviewed and updated as required.  All
        data in the Natural Values Atlas is carefully scrutinized by the NVA team
        who draw on the support of relevant experts to ensure that the data is of
        the highest quality possible.  This is an ongoing task for which the NVA team
        welcomes feedback and input from NVA users to continually improve the quality
        of the data.\nThe NVA is supported by Metadata and Business Rules.  These
        are available from within the NVA or on request.\nThe Natural Values Atlas
        undergoes constant review and improvement where existing functionality is

        Data collection took place from 1992 through 2012, and the voluntary monitoring
        work was carried out by members of the Danish Botanical Society. For this
        project, Denmark was divided into 2228 squares of 5 × 5 km. In all investigated
        squares, all plant species were recorded, with exact location. About every
        other square were surveyed and thereby obtaining good coverage of the whole
        country. The project gratefully received sponsoring from the Aage V. Jensen
        Nature Foundation. Atlas Flora Danica''s purpose is to: 1) Show the Danish
        plant species’ current distribution and regional frequency, including decline
        or spread of species. Causes of these changes are discussed. 2) Examine the
        current status of red-listed, protected and rare plant species. 3) Publicize
        the Danish flora and the importance of protecting the plants and their habitats.

        at the Survey now houses over 6,000,000 curated specimens. The growth and
        wide-ranging scope of this collection can be credited to the diverse interests
        of the systematists who have spent all or part of their career at the Survey.
        Scientists such as Stephen A. Forbes, the first Director of the State Laboratory
        and Chief of the Natural History Survey; Theodore Frison, who succeeded Forbes;
        and H. H. Ross, who directed the intense systematics studies of the faunistic
        section for 40 years, placed considerable emphasis on enlarging the insect
        collection. These insects document the changing landscape and environmental
        conditions of the world.\n\nThe INHS insect collection is one of the largest
        in North America. The most recent size estimate was done in 1992. The heavy
        concentration of specimens from the last third of the 1800s also makes this
        one of North America''s oldest insect and related arthropod collections. \n\nThe
        INHS Insect Collection includes more than 13,000 primary types (syntypes inclusive).
        Because of size, historical holdings, and wide breadth of coverage in certain
        groups, the collection is an important national and worldwide resource.","type":"OCCURRENCE","hostingOrganizationKey":"fd0038d0-3e7b-11d9-8439-b8a03c50a862","hostingOrganizationTitle":"Illinois

        Wetland Inventory (NV)","description":"The national wetland inventory (VMI)
        has for 25 years made inventories of Swedish wetlands that are situated below
        the mountain range. Wetlands have been defined in VMI as: \"Land where water,
        for a large part of the year, is close to, in or above the ground, as well
        as vegetation-covered water areas. At least 50% of the vegetation should be
        hydrophilic, i.e. moisture loving, in order for it to be called a wetland
        area. An exception is sometimes dry-laid bottom areas of lakes, seas and streams.
        They count as wetlands even though they lack vegetation. \" \n\nIn total,
        VMI has invented 35,000 sites with a total area of 4.3 million hectares, which
        corresponds to 10% of Sweden''s total land area. The purpose of the inventories
        has been to create a knowledge bank over the country''s wetlands, which can
        be used for environmental monitoring and natural resource planning. By examining
        how and in what range wetlands are affected by human activities and by identifying
        valuable wetlands, their values can be preserved for the future. Inventory
        data was also planned to provide a basis for the authorities'' handling of
        e.g. land drainage and logging.\n\nFor practical reasons inventories has only
        been performed at larger wetlands below the mountain ranges. In northern Sweden
        inventories took place at all wetlands larger than 50 ha and in all wetlands
        in southern Sweden wetlands larger than 10 ha. All inventoried wetlands have
        been analyzed with aerial photos and remote sensing and has been classified
        according to the status of the nature values. A total of 12% of wetlands have
        also been visited in order to provide further knowledge. Based on the remote
        sensing, all wetlands were classified into one of the 47 different wetland
        types. Based on the spatial extent of wetland types, we have divided Sweden
        into five different marsh/bog-regions: Fell bog, Palsa bog, String bog, Raised
        bog and Pine bog/Beach wetland bog. \n\nThe results of the VMI are regularly
        used by county administrative boards and municipalities and have been an important
        tool for national protection of wetlands. The regional inventories have been
        made by the various county administrative boards and the Swedish Environmental
        Protection Agency has acted as coordinator for the project.\n\nThe digital
        data contains the delimitation of the VMI areas, a central coordinate and
        an ID (LOID). Via ID, you can extract data from access databases with information
        about species inventoried. More information on the project can be found at

        a precious collection of zoological, anthropological, paleontological, mineralogical
        and geological materials and data. The renowned Iguanodons from Bernissart,
        ambassadors of the Belgian science institute in Brussels, represent a natural
        history collection currently estimated to hold over 37 million specimens.
        The roots of the present day collection reach far back in history. It evolved
        from the Natural History collection of Karel of Lotharingen, governor of The
        Netherlands (1712-1780) and was part of didactic materials owned by the Central
        School of the City of Brussels. After the independence of Belgium, the City
        of Brussels donated the collection to the Belgian Government and became part
        of the autonomous Royal Natural History Museum in 1846, known as the Royal
        Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences since 1948. Fieldwork by researchers
        and collaborators, in Belgium and abroad, donations and purchases have been
        expanding the assets ever since. Data presented here are coming from the darwin
        database, the collection management tool of the RBINS. Today, the darwin database
        manages information on about 350.000 specimens stored in the institute''s
        depositories. This number rises on a daily basis thanks to the continued efforts
        of curators and their adjuncts that are responsible for maintaining the stored
        specimens and information. Our online database provides information about
        the collections of the Vertebrates, Invertebrates, Entomology and Paleobotany.
        The application will soon be expanded with paleontozoological data. The Department
        of Geology and the Department of Marine Ecosystems provide information on
        different systems. More information on these departments can be found on www.sciencesnaturelles.be/institute/structure/geology/gsb_website
        and www.mumm.ac.be The corner stone of the darwin database is the specimen
        and the information about its origin and its status. Although the status of
        the specimens sollow the current regulations of the International Code on
        Zoological Nomenclature other status specifications not treated by the ICZN

        study of deep-sea sediments cored over several decades by the DSDP, ODP and
        IODP drilling programs has yielded a vast body of information on the occurrences
        of individual fossil marine plankton species over time. This information also
        has been combined with other types of geochronologic information by interdisciplinary
        teams of scientists to construct detailed age estimates - age models - for
        hundreds of deep-sea drilling sections. Together, this information provides
        a uniquely detailed history of of biologic evolution in the oceans, as well
        as an important source of geochronologic information for geologic studies
        of ocean and climate change.    The Neptune database provides integrated access
        to this global data-set. It contains over 500,000 records for the occurrences
        of species in individual, numerically age-dated samples, age models for hundreds
        of deep-sea sections, and extensive, annotated, quality-controlled taxonomic
        lists for thousands of fossil marine plankton species. Neptune, or analyses
        from it, have been used in over 30 research papers (median ISI 3.5), including
        8 in Science, Nature or PNAS.    Neptune was originally created by a team
        led by me in the early 1990s at the ETH in Zürich, and re-cast in internet
        form, with the addition of more data, by the Chronos project of NSF in the
        early 2000s. In response to the lapse of Chronos and support for Neptune,
        I teamed up with Patrick Diver, the main Chronos database programmer, to create
        a new version of Neptune (Neptune Sandbox Berlin, or NSB) that is hosted at
        the Museum für Naturkunde. Extensive reprogramming has streamlined the system
        so that it is easier to maintain, and includes support for direct programmable
        access over the internet for advanced research purposes. This project was
        supported by CEES, Oslo. NSB currently does not have a web-interface but one
        is planned to be added by early 2013.    NSB has already been used in published
        research within my own group, and to provide data on request to external scientists.
        Broader collaborations and renewed general public access via the web interface
        are planned for the future.","type":"OCCURRENCE","hostingOrganizationKey":"10980920-6dad-11da-ad13-b8a03c50a862","hostingOrganizationTitle":"Museum
