        contains a broad spectrum of species and specimens from all over the world.
        However, the major focus of the collections concerns the triclad flatworms
        or planarians (Order Tricladida). From this group many species and specimens
        are available of marine, freshwater, as well as terrestrial planarians, including
        385 type specimens. The beginning of these collections of planarians can be
        traced back to J. C. C. Loman (1856 - 1929), who described 16 new species
        of bipaliid land planarians. The collections were considerably expanded with
        the incorporation of the collection of Prof. Dr. Masaharu Kawakatsu into the

        in the Atlantic Ocean: Amsterdam Island, Ascension, Cape Verde Archipelago,
        Inaccessible Island, St. Helena, São Tomé and Principe, Tristan da Cunha,
        and the islands in the Indian Ocean: Comores (Anjouan, Grande Comore, Mayotte,
        Mohéli), Madagascar, Mascarene Islands (La Réunion, Mauritius, Rodrigues),
        Seychelles (Félicité, Mahé, Praslin, Silhouette, a.o.).\n\nFurthermore, also
        those moth species occurring in the transition zone to the Palaearctic fauna
        have been included, namely most of the Arabia Peninsula (Kuwait, Oman, Saudi
        Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen with Socotra) but not Iraq, Jordan and
        further north. Also, some Saharan species have been included (e. g. Hoggar
        Mts. in Algeria, Tibesti Mts. in South Libya).\n\nUtmost care was taken that

        is the first published database of Bathynellacea. It includes data of bathynellids
        (Crustacea, Bathynellacea) from the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Island
        collected along 64 years (1949 to 2013). The samples come from groundwater
        (caves, springs, wells and hyporrheic habitat associated rivers) from both
        sampling campaigns and occasional sampling conducted throughout the Iberian
        Peninsula and Balearic Islands. The dataset lists ocurrence data of bathynellids
        distribution, sampling sites (with localities, county and geographic coordinates),
        taxonomic information (from family to species level) and sampling sources
        (collector and sampling dates) for all records. The data were compiled by
        A.I. Camacho (AIC) and come from own samples, literature and samples donated
        by several Spanish and foreign researchers which were studied by AIC. The
        descriptions of new species and species identifications have been carried
        out by an expert taxonomist (AIC) with 25 years experience in the bathynellids
        studies. Many of the sampling sites are type localities of endemic species
        from Iberian Peninsula. The data set includes 409 samples record corresponding
        to two families, 12 genera and 60 species, 42 of them formally described plus
        18 taxa unpublished. This represents everything known for the study area,
        and nearly a quarter of all known species of Bathynellacea in the world. The

        Distribution and Taxonomic Reference Dataset of Geranium (Geraniaceae) in
        the New World","description":"The dataset includes 8937 records that  covers  genus
        Geranium  the New World, providing an updated, taxonomically consistent and
        a sound geographical  distribution of the 137 species of Geranium in America.
        These are the studied specimens on which following monograph was based:\n\nAedo,
        Carlos (2012). Revision of Geranium (Geraniaceae) in the New World. Systematic
        Botany Monographs 95: 550p.\nBesides the exhaustive taxonomic work done, and
        reflected in the dataset, a detailed revision of the locality of the specimens
        was performed, and geographic coordinates could be assigned with a 1 minute
        accuracy in c. 6500 records. Duplicate specimens kept in different collections
        have been aggregated into single records. Specimens from 128 herbaria were
        reviewed. These were supplemented by others collected during nine field trips,
        which allowed to know better the variability of characters within populations,
        and refine species distribution ranges. These expeditions took place in Argentina,
        Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, United States and Venezuela, and
        yielded 235 herbarium specimens of Geranium belonging to 46 species.\nThe
        potential for this dataset to be widely reused is very high, given the level
        of taxonomic and geographic scrutiny this dataset encompasses, its completeness,
        and the fact that Geranium is a well-known genus, widely used in horticulture
        and for pharmaceutical products.","type":"OCCURRENCE","hostingOrganizationKey":"6c4a0bb0-2a4d-11d8-aa2d-b8a03c50a862","hostingOrganizationTitle":"GBIF-Spain","countryCoverage":[],"publishingCountry":"ES","publishingOrganizationKey":"0363cbd4-f666-455e-8e86-0bbddcf51950","publishingOrganizationTitle":"CSIC-Real
